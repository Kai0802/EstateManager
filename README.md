### Error 1:

```plaintext
node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1473 return process.dlopen(module, path.toNamespacedPath(filename));
```

For this error, simply delete the `node_modules` directory with the command `rm -rf node_modules`, and run the command `npm update`.  
**Remember to do this in the `api` folder**

```bash
cd api
rm -rf node_modules
npm update
```

### Error 2:

```plaintext
Failed to load module @rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc. Required DLL was not found.
```

This error usually happens when the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is not installed. You can download it from [here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

We can fix this error by installing an older version of Vite with the command `npm install vite@4.4.0`, and then rerun the program with `npm run dev`.  
**Remember to do this in the `client` folder**

```bash
cd client
npm install vite@4.4.0
npm run dev
```
